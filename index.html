            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most
                people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover
                without requiring special treatment.
                Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
                respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and
                slow down transmission is be
                well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and
                others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching
                your face. The COVID-19 virus
                spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs
                or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing
                into a flexed elbow). At this time,
                there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical
                trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as
                clinical findings become available.</p>
